# Performance Optimizations Guide

Clipper UI is designed with performance as a top priority. This guide details the performance optimizations implemented in the library and how to leverage them in your application.

## Component-Specific Builds

One of the most significant performance optimizations in Clipper UI is the component-specific build system, which dramatically reduces bundle sizes for applications that only use a subset of components.

### How It Works

Each component is built into its own separate bundle with:
- CommonJS (CJS) format for Node.js environments
- ES Modules (ESM) format for modern bundlers
- TypeScript declarations for type safety
- Minified and optimized code

### Bundle Size Comparison

| Import Method | Size | When to Use |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| Full Library | ~84KB | When using many components |
| Table Component | ~16KB | When only using Table |
| Button Component | ~4KB | When only using Button |
| TextField Component | ~8KB | When only using TextField |

### Usage

To leverage component-specific builds:

```jsx
// RECOMMENDED: Import specific components for smaller bundles
import Button from 'clipper-ui/dist/components/Button';
import Table from 'clipper-ui/dist/components/Table';

// NOT RECOMMENDED: Import from main bundle (larger)
// import { Button, Table } from 'clipper-ui';
```

### Technical Implementation

The build process uses:
- Rollup to create optimized bundles
- Babel to transpile TypeScript
- TypeScript compiler for accurate type declarations
- Tree-shaking to eliminate unused code

## Runtime Optimizations

In addition to build-time optimizations, Clipper UI includes several runtime performance optimizations:

### Component Memoization

Complex components are wrapped with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

```jsx
// Example of memoized Table component
import React, { memo, useCallback, useState } from 'react';

const Table = memo(({ data, columns, ...props }) => {
  // Component implementation
});

export default Table;
```

### Debounced and Throttled Event Handlers

For input-heavy components like search fields or components that handle scroll events, we use debouncing and throttling:

```jsx
// Using our performance utilities
import { debounce, throttle } from 'clipper-ui/utils/performance';

// Debounced search handler
const handleSearch = debounce((searchTerm) => {
  // Implementation
}, 300);

// Throttled scroll handler
const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
  // Implementation
}, 100);
```

### Virtualization for Large Datasets

The Table component implements virtualization for large datasets, rendering only the visible rows:

```jsx
import { Table } from 'clipper-ui';

function VirtualizedTableExample() {
  return (
    <Table
      data={largeDataset} // Thousands of rows
      virtualized={true}
      height="500px"
    />
  );
}
```

### Code Splitting with Lazy Loading

Clipper UI provides a `lazyLoad` utility for components that might not be immediately needed:

```jsx
import { lazyLoad } from 'clipper-ui/utils/lazyLoad';

// Lazy load a dialog that only appears on user action
const LazyDialog = lazyLoad(() => import('clipper-ui/dist/components/Dialog'));

function MyComponent() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  
  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open Dialog</Button>
      {open && <LazyDialog onClose={() => setOpen(false)} />}
    </>
  );
}
```

## Developer Tools

Clipper UI includes several tools to help developers monitor and optimize performance:

### Performance Monitoring

Wrap any component with `PerformanceMonitor` to measure render times and detect performance issues:

```jsx
import { PerformanceMonitor } from 'clipper-ui/utils/performance-monitor';

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <PerformanceMonitor id="table-component">
      <Table data={data} columns={columns} />
    </PerformanceMonitor>
  );
}
```

This will log detailed performance metrics to the console during development.

### Component Optimization Checklist

When building components with Clipper UI, follow this optimization checklist:

1. **Import specific components** rather than the entire library
2. **Use memoization** for components that render frequently
3. **Implement virtualization** for large lists or tables
4. **Debounce input handlers** and **throttle scroll handlers**
5. **Lazy load components** that aren't needed immediately
6. **Monitor performance** during development

## Measuring and Benchmarking

To measure the performance of your application using Clipper UI:

### Performance Test Script

```bash
# Run the performance test suite
npm run perf:test
```

This script benchmarks component rendering times, bundle sizes, and runtime performance.

### Interpreting Results

The test outputs metrics such as:
- Initial render time
- Re-render time with changed props
- Memory usage
- Bundle size impact

Use these metrics to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

### Custom Benchmarking

Create custom benchmarks for your specific use cases:

```javascript
import { benchmark } from 'clipper-ui/utils/performance';

// Benchmark a specific component or operation
benchmark('TableRender', () => {
  // Your code to benchmark
  renderTable(largeDataset);
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use component-specific imports** for the best performance
2. **Monitor component render times** during development
3. **Consider virtualization** for any list with more than 50 items
4. **Test performance** with realistic data volumes
5. **Use the production build** of Clipper UI for accurate measurements
6. **Consider code splitting** for larger applications

By following these optimization techniques, your application will benefit from the full performance capabilities of Clipper UI.
